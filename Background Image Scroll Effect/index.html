        <p>New Twitter owner Elon Musk has wasted no time restructuring the social media platform.</p>
        <p>With his US$44bn (A$68bn) purchase barely a week old, the company is set to sack as many as 4000 people on Friday morning, US time.</p>
        <p>Australian staff are affected as well as those at the San Francisco headquarters and other offices globally.</p>
        <p>But the method in which those sackings will take place – via email with staff locked out of offices and computers – has seen Musk’s actions characterised as “abuse”.</p>
        <p>There are also questions about whether mass sackings in such as short period of time violate US labour laws.</p>
        <p>One UK employee, who hadn’t been told if he was on the sacked list, said his work computer was wiped right in front of him when he was at home. He said the screen flashed grey which was a sign its data was being remotely erased.</p>
